1.5.1
* Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug where mount would be dismissed even if flight protection was toggled on

1.5.0
* Bugfixes
- Fixed bug where no usable mounts would be found if player tried to mount while in combat
- Fixed a bug where standing on the bottom of the ocean(/any other surface at the bottom of a body of water) would make the underwater check return false
- Added missing "KMount: " to some error messages

* Changes
- Replaced KM_GetMounts() with global KM_GetUsableMounts()
- Minor optimization through removal of the extremely inefficient table.insert
- Changed behavior so that flying mounts can be summoned while submerged, previously only summoned ground mounts if IsSubmerged() returned true
- Changed behavior so that Blizzard's mount manager is default for selecting favorites
- KM_GetUsableMounts() will now ONLY trigger if MOUNT_JOURNAL_USABILITY_CHANGED or MountJournal OnHide event is triggered or if forced through /kmount update
- Added UpdateMountList() instead of directly using deprecated KM_GetMounts()
- Moved API-part into a seperate file, kmount_api.lua
- Moved Poseidus to KM_UnderWaterMounts as it can be used everywhere and is slower than the regular Vashj'ir seahorse
- Will now wait until PLAYER_LOGIN fires before updating usable mount list

* New features
- Will now check for 8 (including sea legs) common spells granting the player underwater breathing, previously only checked breathing resulting in no underwater mounts being used if there was no breath bar
- Added checks to see if a player is dead or ghost to prevent KM_GetMounts() from failing
- Added check to see if player is moving or falling, since mounts cannot be summoned while doing so
- Added a 0.2 second cooldown on summoning mounts for performance reasons
- Can now forcefully update the mount list via /kmount update
- Added a 2 second grace period when resurfacing/submerging preventing underwater mounts and vashj'ir specific mounts from being summoned, since blizzard provide us with no way of knowing if the player is at the surface of water
- Added metatable, KM_GetMountInfo, to cache GetMountInfoExtraByID() results, automatically map to GetMountIDs() to make it iterable without using pairs and hold a count of mount id span (1-570 as of writing)
- Added a few more debug messages
- Can now list counts of all usable mounts via /kmount mountcount
- Added a ownership test to isValidMount() so that the player can't /kmount setg/f a mount they do not own. It's still possible though to set mounts the player might not be able to use (engineering mounts etc)
